	// point, the talker controls both lines, Clock and Data.  At the beginning of the sequence, it is holding the 
	// Clock true, while the Data line is released to false.  the Data line will change soon, since we'll sendthe data 
	// over it. The eights bits will go out from the character one at a time, with the least significant bit going first.  
	// For example, if the character is the ASCII question mark, which is  written  in  binary  as  00011111,  the  ones  
	// will  go out  first,  followed  by  the  zeros.  Now,  for  each bit, we set the Data line true or false according 
	// to whether the bit is one or zero.  As soon as that'sset, the Clock line is released to false, signalling "data ready."  
	// The talker will typically have a bit in  place  and  be  signalling  ready  in  70  microseconds  or  less.  Once  
	// the  talker  has  signalled  "data ready," it will hold the two lines steady for at least 20 microseconds timing needs 
	// to be increased to 60  microseconds  if  the  Commodore  64  is  listening,  since  the  64's  video  chip  may  
	// interrupt  the processor for 42 microseconds at a time, and without the extra wait the 64 might completely miss a 
	// bit. The listener plays a passive role here; it sends nothing, and just watches.  As soon as it sees the Clock line 
	// false, it grabs the bit from the Data line and puts it away.  It then waits for the clock line to go true, in order 
	// to prepare for the next bit. When the talker figures the data has been held for a sufficient  length  of  time,  it  
	// pulls  the  Clock  line true  and  releases  the  Data  line  to  false.    Then  it starts to prepare the next bit.

	TURNAROUND
	An unusual sequence takes place following ATN if the computer wishes the remote device to

	Immediately after ATN is released, the selected device will be behaving like a listener. After all, it's
	been listening during the ATN cycle, and the computer
	has been a talker. At this instant, we have "wrong way" logic; the device is holding down the Data
	line, and the computer is holding the Clock line. We must turn this around. Here's the sequence:
	the computer quickly realizes what's going on, and pulls the Data line to true (it's already there), as
	well as releasing the Clock line to false. The device waits for this: when it sees the Clock line go
	true [sic], it releases the Data line (which stays true anyway since the computer is now holding it down)
	and then pulls down the Clock line. We're now in our starting position, with the talker (that's the
	device) holding the Clock true, and the listener (the computer) holding the Data line true. The
	computer watches for this state; only when it has gone through the cycle correctly will it be ready
	to receive data. And data will be signalled, of course, with the usual sequence: the talker releases
	the Clock line to signal that it's ready to send.

 * takes place as previously described. The computer is sending commands rather than data, but the
